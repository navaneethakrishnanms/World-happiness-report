###Part 1 – Basic Data Understanding (Pandas)
Load the dataset and display the first 10 rows.
Show the shape, column names, and data types.
Check for missing values and duplicates.
Use .describe() to view summary statistics for numeric columns.
Get the number of unique countries and regions.
Find the country with the highest happiness score.
Find the most common region.

###Part 2 – EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Plot a histogram of happiness scores.
Find the top 10 happiest countries.
Find the bottom 10 countries by happiness score.
Create a bar chart showing average happiness score per region.
Scatter plot: GDP per capita vs Happiness score.
Boxplot of happiness scores grouped by region.

###Part 3 – Statistics
Calculate mean, median, and mode of Ladder score.
Find variance and standard deviation of Ladder score.
Percentage of countries with happiness score below global average.
Most common region among top 20 countries by happiness.

###Part 4 – Linear Algebra & NumPy
Create NumPy arrays for Ladder score and Logged GDP per capita.
Perform vector addition and subtraction.
Compute the dot product between these arrays.
Create a matrix [GDP per capita, Social support] and multiply with weights [0.5, 0.5].
Normalize the Ladder score array.

###Part 5 – Calculus
Assume:
 Wellbeing_Index = (GDP×Happiness) + 0.5×(Happiness−5)^2
 Find derivative wrt Happiness.

###Part 6 – Feature Engineering
Create is_happy = 1 if happiness score > 7 else 0.
Create happiness_rank based on descending Ladder score.
Create above_average_gdp = 1 if GDP > global mean.
Create quartiles based on Healthy life expectancy.

###Part 7 – SQL Simulation in Pandas
Select all countries with happiness score > 7.
Sort countries by GDP per capita descending.
Group by region and calculate average happiness score.
Get the top 5 regions by average happiness score.
Select countries where Healthy life expectancy > 70.

###Part 8 – Insights
Which country is the happiest?
Which region is the happiest on average?
Is GDP per capita strongly correlated with happiness?
Do richer countries always have higher happiness scores?
Which region has the highest average life expectancy?
